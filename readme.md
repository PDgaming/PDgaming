Hey to whoever is reading this. My name is PD and this is my gihub account.
You can find the code for some of the projects that i have done or are doing. you will mostly find code for websites ie html, css and javascript code. but there will also be some other project files like python files. 
Hope you all will like my account and find my projects helpfull. I make lots of projects in python where i try to make daily maths problems easier mostly to help other students like me.
I don't hate maths nor am i bad in maths but still doing some things in maths can be really boring espicially if they are too long and that is whatr i try to fix.
I will soon be uploading mmore projects on this account which will involve those projects.
I am still very new to programming even after learning programming for more that 4 years now. I still need lots of skills and experience. 
I still have to learn a lot, and i think that the more i will create, the more i will learn. On github i can upload my code and get feedback from you guys and i can improve.
so with that in mind i crearted this account, hope i will be able to learn from you guys and also help you guys.
