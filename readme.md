Hey there! My name is PD and this is my gihub account.
You can find the code for some of the projects that i have worked on or are working on. you will mostly find code for websites ie html, css and javascript code. but there will also be some other project files like python files. 
Hope you all will like my account and find my projects helpfull.
I will soon be uploading more projects on this account which will involve many more projects.
I am still very new to programming even after learning programming for more that 4 years now. I still need lots of skills and experience. 
I still have lots to learn, and i think that the more i will create, the more i will learn. On github i can upload my code and get feedback from you guys and i can improve.
so with that in mind i created this account, hope i will be able to learn from you guys and also help you guys.
